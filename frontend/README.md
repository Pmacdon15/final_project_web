# Description
This project is a mockup of the Bow Valley College Portal, designed to allow users to manage their academic experience. Users will be able to add and organize programs, enroll in classes, and customize their profile page. The project will be developed and delivered in three phases, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.

# Features
## Current Features
1.
## Coming Soon
1. User Authentication: Secure login functionality for users.
2. Profile Management: View and update user profile details.
3. Program Enrollment: Add new programs to track academic progress.
4. Class Registration: Add classes within each program.
5. Program Removal: Remove an entire program, including all associated classes.
6. Class Removal: Un-enroll from individual classes.
7. Contact Support: Send questions or inquiries via email directly through the portal.
8. Admin Dashboard: View and manage user-submitted questions on the admin side.

# Phases
## Phase 1
Phase One will focus on building the front end using React. This phase will simulate the core functionality of the app by saving and managing data locally in JSON format. Mock data will be pre-loaded when the application starts, allowing users to interact with a realistic interface without back-end integration at this stage.

## Phase 2
Phase Two will focus on building the back-end infrastructure using Node.js and Express to create a REST API that serves data to the front-end. During this phase, the portal will transition from using locally stored JSON data to a fully integrated back-end system with a database for persistent storage. The API will handle all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users, programs, and classes. Additionally, the back-end will include robust data validation and error handling to ensure a reliable and secure user experience.
## Phase 3
Phase three will focus on bringing the first two phases together to create a fully functioning full stack application.
